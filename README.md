[Worldguard 3.1.0 Update]

Removed code.
Worldguard has been selected.
Flag: First applied to Falling-blocks.

In previous versions, flags for the entire world and a specific range were applied as if they were Falling-blocks.
For example, you could recruit Falling-blocks in a specific area and have them act as if they were recruited world-wide, giving the server parts.

Currently, priority is applied and Falling-blocks are welcomed as a global item within a specific range.

Note: Added item.
Welcome to blocking live in the area.

Format: Fixed an error in exiting the exit.

Optimized Worldguard performance.
Some files were incorrectly written.

Commemorated the memory of the Anniversary API.
